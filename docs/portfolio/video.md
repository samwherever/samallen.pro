As part of rebuilding [Sertifi's support center](support_sites.md), I also completely rebuilt how support videos were created, produced, and published. These videos were written, narrated, designed, animated, and edited by me.

Features of note:

* Use of brand colors and fonts
* Custom writing and voice overs
* Custom animation
* Tables of content and built-in chaptering for easy navigation and searching
* Full captioning
