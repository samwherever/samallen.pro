Through a REST API, a program can connect to a different program via the Web in order to perform CRUD operations - Create, Replace, Update, or Delete. The Sertifi REST API enables a client's application to connect to the Sertifi application to access and edit booking data (signatures, participants, payments, etc).</p> <p>For Sertifi, the REST and SOAP APIs serve the same purpose - enabling clients to connect to our application - but each client will use either SOAP or REST depending on their technical resources and requirements. In particular, the REST API tends to be more commonly used, as it's easier and cheaper to set up and run.</p> <p>Tip</p> <p>REST is like a Ferrari - popular because it's fast, flexible, and more fun to use.</p> <p>SOAP is like an ambulance - used for very important reasons, but typically reserved only for situations where it's truly needed.</p> <p>REST API Advantages</p> <ul> <li>REST APIs can send and receive data in JSON, CSV, or RSS formats, which are used by a wide variety of programming languages, such as JavaScript, Python, Ruby, and Go.</li> <li>REST calls use common English verbs (GET, POST, PUT, DELETE) in order to describe their purpose, making it easier to understand what a particular function is intended to accomplish.</li> <li>The response codes for REST are the same as HTTP response codes used across the web, which can make it easier to understand if a call was successful or not, and why. For instance, a GET call requesting a resource that could not be found would result in the familiar 404 NOT FOUND error message.</li> <li>REST uses significantly less bandwidth than SOAP, making the process faster and much more efficient.</li> <li>The JSON format commonly used by REST APIs is easier to work with than the XML format used by SOAP APIs. For example, to input data for a group of four people using XML, you'd have to write something like:</li> </ul> <pre><code>&lt;band_members&gt;\n    &lt;member&gt;\n       &lt;name&gt;John&lt;/name&gt;\n       &lt;instrument&gt;Guitar&lt;/instrument&gt;\n    &lt;/member&gt;\n    &lt;member&gt;\n       &lt;name&gt;Paul&lt;/name&gt;\n       &lt;instrument&gt;Bass Guitar&lt;/instrument&gt;\n    &lt;/member&gt;\n    &lt;member&gt;\n      &lt;name&gt;George&lt;/name&gt;\n      &lt;instrument&gt;Guitar&lt;/instrument&gt;\n    &lt;/member&gt;\n    &lt;member&gt;\n      &lt;name&gt;Ringo&lt;/name&gt;\n      &lt;instrument&gt;Drums&lt;/instrument&gt;\n    &lt;/member&gt;\n&lt;/band_members&gt;</code></pre> <p>To accomplish the same thing in JSON, all you would need to write is:</p> <pre><code>\"band_members\":[\n     {\n       \"name\": \"John\",\n       \"instrument\":\"guitar\"\n     },\n     {\n        \"name\": \"Paul\",\n      \"instrument\":\"bass guitar\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"name\": \"George\",\n      \"instrument\":\"guitar\"\n    },\n    {\n     \"name\": \"Ringo\",\n      \"instrument\":\"drums\"\n    }\n ]</code></pre>"},{"location":"portfolio/product-documentation/","title":"Product Documentation","text":""},{"location":"portfolio/release-notes/","title":"Release Notes","text":"<p>At Sertifi, I completely rebuilt how release notes were written, categorized, and published.
